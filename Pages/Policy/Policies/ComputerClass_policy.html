            <h2>Important Notice to All Students</h2>

            <p>We would like to remind all students that each computer class session is 1 hour long. It has been
                observed that some students are leaving before the class ends. Please note that if a student leaves the
                class early, the computer teacher and the institute are not responsible for any incidents or issues that
                may arise outside of class hours.</p>

            <p>We urge all students to adhere to the scheduled class times. This policy is in place to ensure the safety
                and success of all participants. Furthermore, we have noticed that some students are discontinuing their
                classes before completing the course. To address this, the following policies will be strictly enforced:
            </p>


            <h2>Leave Policy</h2>
            <ul class="card-list">
                <li>Students must inform the computer teacher or an institute staff member if they need to take a leave
                    of absence.</li>
                <li>For emergency leaves, notification should be provided as soon as possible and must be supported by
                    appropriate documentation (e.g., medical certificates).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Uninformed Absence</h2>
            <ul class="card-list">
                <li>If a student is absent for a week or more without prior notice, it will be assumed that they have
                    chosen to discontinue the course permanently.</li>
                <li>Such students who wish to rejoin will be required to restart their course from the beginning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Re-enrollment Policy</h2>
            <ul class="card-list">
                <li>Students who discontinue their course without informing the institute and later wish to rejoin must
                    re-enroll and pay the course fees again. Previous progress will not be credited.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Punctuality</h2>
            <ul class="card-list">
                <li>Students are expected to arrive on time for every class. Consistent lateness will be recorded, and
                    repeated instances may lead to disciplinary action, including possible suspension from the course.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Class Participation</h2>
            <ul class="card-list">
                <li>Active participation in classes is mandatory. Students are expected to engage in discussions,
                    complete assignments, and participate in all activities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>To prevent misunderstandings, students must notify the computer teacher or an institute staff member if
                they plan to take a leave. Failure to do so will be considered as permanent withdrawal from the
                institute.</h3>

            <h2>Mobile Phone and Media Restrictions</h2>
            <h3>To maintain a focused learning environment, the following guidelines are to be strictly followed

                <li><strong>Focus on Studies:</strong> Students are encouraged to fully utilize class time by

                    unless due to documented emergencies.</li>
