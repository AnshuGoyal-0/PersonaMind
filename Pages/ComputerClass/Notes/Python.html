            <li> Dead comments or code should be deleted</li>
            <p> Any unused piece of code or comments should be deleted. The best place to find them is in the version control systems.</p>
            <li>Incorrect behaviour at boundaries.</li>
            <p>Boundaries should always be unit tested. No behaviour should be assumed.</p>

            <p>All the set standard architecture, coding, and design guidelines should be adhered to. Tools should also be used to ensure that this is accurate.</p>
            <li>Good and Consistent naming</li>
            <p> Try to call variables, methods, classes to be understandable from the caller perspective. And it should be consistent.</p>
            <li>KISS principle should be applied</li>
            <p>Needless complexity should be avoided. With increase in complexity, some design and codes in the system become useless. All designs and codes should be kept as simple as possible.</p>
            <li>Use of exceptions instead of return codes</li>
            <p>In exceptional cases, an exception should be thrown, when the method fails to do its intended purpose. Null or return codes shouldn’t be used.</p>
            <li>Make things small. Class size and method size both matter</li>
            <p>Typically, method should be small and compact in size. Ideally</p>

                <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which

                    Python supports OOP through its class system. Classes are used to create objects, and you can define
                    methods and attributes within these classes.</p>

                <h3>239. What is polymorphism in Python?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                <p>Polymorphism is a concept in programming that allows methods to do different things based on the
                    object it is acting upon. In Python, polymorphism allows methods to be overridden in child classes,
                    providing different implementations for the same method name. It enables objects of different
                    classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.</p>
                <p><strong>Hint:</strong> Polymorphism allows objects to use methods that are named the same but behave
                    differently depending on the object.</p>
                <p><strong>Riddle:</strong> I allow a method to have different implementations based on the type of
                    object that invokes it. What am I?</p>
                <p><strong>Short Story:</strong> Michael's application needed different behaviors for different types of
                    objects. By implementing polymorphism, he was able to use the same method name for different objects
                    while providing specific functionality for each type.</p>
