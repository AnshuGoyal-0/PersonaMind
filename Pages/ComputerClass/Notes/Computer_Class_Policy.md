## Important Notice to All Students

We would like to remind all students that each computer class session is 1 hour long. It has been observed that some students are leaving before the class ends. Please note that if a student leaves the class early, the computer teacher and the institute are not responsible for any incidents or issues that may arise outside of class hours.

We urge all students to adhere to the scheduled class times. This policy is in place to ensure the safety and success of all participants. Furthermore, we have noticed that some students are discontinuing their classes before completing the course. To address this, the following policies will be strictly enforced:

## Leave Policy

* Students must inform the computer teacher or an institute staff member if they need to take a leave of absence.
* For emergency leaves, notification should be provided as soon as possible and must be supported by appropriate documentation (e.g., medical certificates).

## Uninformed Absence

* If a student is absent for a week or more without prior notice, it will be assumed that they have chosen to discontinue the course permanently.
* Such students who wish to rejoin will be required to restart their course from the beginning.

## Re-enrollment Policy

* Students who discontinue their course without informing the institute and later wish to rejoin must re-enroll and pay the course fees again. Previous progress will not be credited.

## Punctuality

* Students are expected to arrive on time for every class. Consistent lateness will be recorded, and repeated instances may lead to disciplinary action, including possible suspension from the course.

## Class Participation

* Active participation in classes is mandatory. Students are expected to engage in discussions, complete assignments, and participate in all activities.

### To prevent misunderstandings, students must notify the computer teacher or an institute staff member if they plan to take a leave. Failure to do so will be considered as permanent withdrawal from the institute.

## Mobile Phone and Media Restrictions

### To maintain a focused learning environment, the following guidelines are to be strictly followed regarding the use of mobile phones and access to media:

* **Mobile Phones:** Mobile phones must be kept on silent mode and stored away during class. Usage during class hours is strictly prohibited.
* **YouTube and Social Media:** Accessing YouTube, Reels, or other social media on institute computers is prohibited unless explicitly approved by the teacher for educational purposes. Non-educational content is not allowed.
* **Focus on Studies:** Students are encouraged to fully utilize class time by concentrating on their studies and participating in class activities.
* **Disciplinary Actions:** Violations of these guidelines will result in disciplinary actions. Repeated violations may lead to further consequences as per the institute’s disciplinary policies.

## Homework and Assignments

* All homework and assignments must be submitted on time. Late submissions will incur penalties, unless due to documented emergencies.
* Assignments submitted late, without prior approval, may result in a reduction of marks or other consequences.

## Respect and Conduct

* All students must treat their peers and staff with respect and courtesy at all times.
* Any form of bullying, harassment, or disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated and will result in disciplinary action, including possible suspension or expulsion from the institute.

## Use of Institute Resources

* Institute resources, including computers, software, and study materials, should be used responsibly and solely for educational purposes.
* Any damage to institute property must be reported immediately. Students responsible for such damage may be required to cover the costs of repairs or replacement.

## Data Privacy and Security

* Students must respect the privacy and security of the institute’s data and networks. Unauthorized access or sharing of sensitive information is strictly prohibited.
* Any breach of data security, intentional or otherwise, will result in disciplinary action, potentially including suspension or legal action.

## Health and Safety

* Students must adhere to all health and safety guidelines provided by the institute, including those related to hygiene and, if applicable, COVID-19 protocols.
* Health concerns should be reported to the computer teacher or institute staff immediately.
* Students are encouraged to maintain a healthy balance between study and rest.

## Attendance

* Attendance is mandatory for all scheduled classes. A minimum attendance of 75% is required to be eligible for course completion certificates.
* Absences must be reported in advance. Chronic absenteeism without valid reasons may result in the student being dropped from the course.

## Technology Use

* Students are encouraged to use technology to enhance their learning experience. However, misuse of technology, including hacking, unauthorized software installation, or accessing inappropriate content, is strictly prohibited.
* Students must use their own login credentials to access institute resources and should not share them with others. Misuse of login credentials will result in immediate disciplinary action.

## Feedback and Grievance Redressal

* Students are encouraged to provide feedback on their learning experience. Feedback forms will be provided at the end of each course.
* Students with grievances or complaints should approach the computer teacher or the institute’s management. All grievances will be addressed promptly and fairly.
