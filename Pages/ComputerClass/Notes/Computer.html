    <h2>Input Devices</h2>
    <p>Input devices are hardware used to provide data and control signals to a computer. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> Used to input text and commands.</li>
        <li><strong>Mouse:</strong> A pointing device used to interact with graphical elements on the screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Scanner:</strong> Converts physical documents into digital format.</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Captures audio input.</li>
        <li><strong>Webcam:</strong> Captures video input for communication and recording.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Output Devices</h2>
    <p>Output devices are hardware used to convey information from the computer to the user. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Displays visual output from the computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Printer:</strong> Produces physical copies of digital documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Speakers:</strong> Output audio from the computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Projector:</strong> Projects visual output onto a larger surface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
    <p>The CPU is the primary component responsible for executing instructions and processing data. It performs the

    <h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
    <p>RAM is the computer's short-term memory. It temporarily stores data that the CPU is currently working on. This
        allows for quick access to data and speeds up processing. RAM is volatile, meaning it loses its data when the
        computer is turned off.</p>

    <h2>Read-Only Memory (ROM)</h2>
    <p>ROM is non-volatile memory that permanently stores essential instructions required for booting up the computer
        and performing basic functions. Unlike RAM, the data in ROM is not lost when the computer is powered off.</p>

    <h2>Additional Components</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hard Disk Drive (HDD):</strong> A traditional storage device that uses spinning disks to read/write
            data.</li>
        <li><strong>Solid State Drive (SSD):</strong> A faster storage device that uses flash memory instead of spinning
            disks.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU):</strong> Specialized processor designed to handle graphics and video
            processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Supply Unit (PSU):</strong> Converts electrical power from an outlet into a usable form for
            the computer components.</li>
        <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> The main circuit board that houses the CPU, RAM, and other essential
            components, providing connectivity between them.</li>
    </ul>

        <p class="story">Welcome to the exciting world of computers! Today, we're going to embark on a journey to understand what
            computers are and how they work. We'll explore this topic through stories that make learning fun for everyone,
            regardless of age. Let's dive in!</p>
        <h2>The Tale of Sir Compute-a-Lot</h2>
        <div class="story">
            <p>Once upon a time, in a land of gears and gadgets, there was a wise old knight named Sir Compute-a-Lot. He
                lived in a grand castle filled with wondrous machines. Sir Compute-a-Lot was famous for his magical device
                called the "Computer."</p>
    
            <p>Sir Compute-a-Lot's computer was a marvelous invention. It could solve puzzles, calculate numbers, and even
                help the villagers send messages across the kingdom. He explained to everyone that a computer is like a very
                fast and clever assistant. It follows instructions (or <strong>programs</strong>) to perform tasks and help
                solve problems.</p>
    
            <p>The computer had three main parts: the <strong>brain</strong> (known as the CPU), the <strong>eyes</strong>
                (the monitor), and the <strong>hands</strong> (the keyboard and mouse). Together, these parts worked
                harmoniously to complete any task Sir Compute-a-Lot needed.</p>
        </div>
    
        <h2>The Adventure of Bits and Bytes</h2>
        <div class="story">
            <p>In a bustling village named DataLand, tiny magical creatures called Bits and Bytes lived. Bits were the
                smallest of the creatures, and they could only be either a 1 or a 0. Bytes were a bit larger and made up of
                8 Bits working together.</p>
    
            <p>One day, the village faced a problem—an important message had to be sent across the land, but it was too
                large to fit into a single Bit. The Bytes, being clever, came together to organize and send the message in
                pieces. Each Byte carried a part of the message, and when they reached their destination, the message was
                reassembled perfectly.</p>
    
            <p>Through their adventure, Bits and Bytes showed the villagers how computers store and process information
                using binary code—a system of 1s and 0s. This system helps the computer understand and manage all the data
                it handles.</p>

            <li><strong>Briefly explain the difference between hardware and software.</strong><br>
                Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system, such as the monitor, keyboard, mouse, CPU, RAM, and hard drive. You can see and touch hardware. Software is a collection of instructions that tell the hardware what to do. Software is intangible and cannot be physically touched.
            </li>
    
            <li><strong>Describe the function of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) in a computer.</strong><br>
                The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It is responsible for processing instructions and data. It fetches, decodes, and executes instructions from software programs.
            </li>
    
            <li><strong>What are the different types of input devices used with computers? Give two examples.</strong><br>
                Input devices are used to enter data and instructions into a computer. Here are two examples:
                <ul>
                    <li>Keyboard: Used for typing text and entering commands.</li>
                    <li>Mouse: Used to point, click, and drag objects on the screen.</li>
                </ul>
                There are many other input devices, such as scanners, webcams, microphones, joysticks, etc.
            </li>
    
            <li><strong>Explain the importance of using strong passwords.</strong><br>
                Strong passwords are important for computer security. They help prevent unauthorized access to your computer and data. A strong password should be:
                <ul>
                    <li>At least 8 characters long</li>
                    <li>A combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols</li>
                    <li>Not a word found in a dictionary or easily guessable personal information (like your birthday)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
    
            <li><strong>Briefly explain what the term "cloud computing" refers to.</strong><br>
                Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services (like storage, servers, databases, software, etc.) over the internet. Users can access these services on-demand from anywhere with an internet connection. They don't need to manage the physical hardware or software themselves.
            </li>

                    <li>Download the installer from the software’s official website or insert the installation media (e.g., a CD or USB drive).</li>
                    <li>Run the installer file, usually named something like setup.exe or install.exe.</li>
                    <li>Follow the on-screen instructions, accepting the license agreement and choosing an installation location if necessary.</li>

            <li><strong>What is a file extension? Give examples of common file extensions and their associated file types.</strong><br>
                Answer: A file extension is the suffix at the end of a filename that indicates the file type. It is typically composed of three or four letters and comes after a period (e.g., .txt, .docx, .jpg). Examples:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>.txt</strong> - Plain text file (opened with Notepad or TextEdit).</li>
                    <li><strong>.docx</strong> - Microsoft Word document.</li>
                    <li><strong>.jpg</strong> - JPEG image file (viewable in most photo viewers).</li>
                    <li><strong>.mp3</strong> - Audio file (played by music software).</li>
                </ul>
                Example: A photo may be saved as <strong>picture.jpg</strong>, indicating it is an image in JPEG format.
            </li>
        </ol>
