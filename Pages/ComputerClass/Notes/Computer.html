    <h2>Input Devices</h2>
    <p>Input devices are hardware used to provide data and control signals to a computer. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> Used to input text and commands.</li>
        <li><strong>Mouse:</strong> A pointing device used to interact with graphical elements on the screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Scanner:</strong> Converts physical documents into digital format.</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> Captures audio input.</li>
        <li><strong>Webcam:</strong> Captures video input for communication and recording.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Output Devices</h2>
    <p>Output devices are hardware used to convey information from the computer to the user. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Displays visual output from the computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Printer:</strong> Produces physical copies of digital documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Speakers:</strong> Output audio from the computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Projector:</strong> Projects visual output onto a larger surface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
    <p>The CPU is the primary component responsible for executing instructions and processing data. It performs the
        following functions:</p>
    <ul>

    <h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
    <p>RAM is the computer's short-term memory. It temporarily stores data that the CPU is currently working on. This
        allows for quick access to data and speeds up processing. RAM is volatile, meaning it loses its data when the
        computer is turned off.</p>

    <h2>Read-Only Memory (ROM)</h2>
    <p>ROM is non-volatile memory that permanently stores essential instructions required for booting up the computer
        and performing basic functions. Unlike RAM, the data in ROM is not lost when the computer is powered off.</p>

    <h2>Additional Components</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hard Disk Drive (HDD):</strong> A traditional storage device that uses spinning disks to read/write
            data.</li>
        <li><strong>Solid State Drive (SSD):</strong> A faster storage device that uses flash memory instead of spinning
            disks.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU):</strong> Specialized processor designed to handle graphics and video
            processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Supply Unit (PSU):</strong> Converts electrical power from an outlet into a usable form for
            the computer components.</li>
        <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> The main circuit board that houses the CPU, RAM, and other essential
            components, providing connectivity between them.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Existing content -->

    <h2>Additional Components and Concepts</h2>
    <ul class="list-style">
        <li><strong>Network Interface Card (NIC):</strong> A hardware component that allows a computer to connect to a

        <li><strong>Expansion Cards:</strong> Additional cards that can be installed in a computer to provide extra
            features or functionalities, such as sound cards, network cards, or additional USB ports.</li>
        <li><strong>Ports and Connectors:</strong> Interfaces on a computer that allow external devices to be connected,
            such as USB ports, HDMI ports, and audio jacks.</li>
        <li><strong>BIOS/UEFI:</strong> Firmware that initializes hardware during the boot process and provides runtime
            services for operating systems and programs.</li>
        <li><strong>Chipset:</strong> A collection of integrated circuits on the motherboard that manage data flow
            between the processor, memory, and peripherals.</li>

        <p class="story">Welcome to the exciting world of computers! Today, we're going to embark on a journey to understand what
            computers are and how they work. We'll explore this topic through stories that make learning fun for everyone,
            regardless of age. Let's dive in!</p>
        <h2>The Tale of Sir Compute-a-Lot</h2>
        <div class="story">
            <p>Once upon a time, in a land of gears and gadgets, there was a wise old knight named Sir Compute-a-Lot. He
                lived in a grand castle filled with wondrous machines. Sir Compute-a-Lot was famous for his magical device
                called the "Computer."</p>
    
            <p>Sir Compute-a-Lot's computer was a marvelous invention. It could solve puzzles, calculate numbers, and even
                help the villagers send messages across the kingdom. He explained to everyone that a computer is like a very
                fast and clever assistant. It follows instructions (or <strong>programs</strong>) to perform tasks and help
                solve problems.</p>
    
            <p>The computer had three main parts: the <strong>brain</strong> (known as the CPU), the <strong>eyes</strong>
                (the monitor), and the <strong>hands</strong> (the keyboard and mouse). Together, these parts worked
                harmoniously to complete any task Sir Compute-a-Lot needed.</p>

            <p>In a bustling village named DataLand, tiny magical creatures called Bits and Bytes lived. Bits were the
                smallest of the creatures, and they could only be either a 1 or a 0. Bytes were a bit larger and made up of
                8 Bits working together.</p>
    
            <p>One day, the village faced a problem—an important message had to be sent across the land, but it was too
                large to fit into a single Bit. The Bytes, being clever, came together to organize and send the message in
                pieces. Each Byte carried a part of the message, and when they reached their destination, the message was
                reassembled perfectly.</p>
    
            <p>Through their adventure, Bits and Bytes showed the villagers how computers store and process information
                using binary code—a system of 1s and 0s. This system helps the computer understand and manage all the data
                it handles.</p>

        <h2>The Journey of Software and Hardware</h2>
        <div class="story">
            <p>In the realm of TechLand, there were two great heroes: Software and Hardware. Hardware was the strong and
                sturdy hero who built the physical parts of the computer—like the CPU, memory, and hard drive. Software, on
                the other hand, was the clever and creative hero who wrote the magical spells (or programs) that told the
                hardware what to do.</p>
    
            <p>Together, Software and Hardware made an excellent team. Hardware provided the tools and resources, while
                Software gave the instructions and made the computer do amazing things, like play games, write stories, and
                even connect people across the globe.</p>
    
            <p>The harmony between Software and Hardware is what makes a computer so powerful and versatile. Each hero needs
                the other to function properly and achieve great feats.</p>
