            Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system, such as the monitor, keyboard, mouse, CPU, RAM, and hard drive. You can see and touch hardware. Software is a collection of instructions that tell the hardware what to do. Software is intangible and cannot be physically touched.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Describe the function of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) in a computer.</strong><br>
            The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It is responsible for processing instructions and data. It fetches, decodes, and executes instructions from software programs.
        </li>

        <li><strong>What are the different types of input devices used with computers? Give two examples.</strong><br>
            Input devices are used to enter data and instructions into a computer. Here are two examples:
            <ul>
                <li>Keyboard: Used for typing text and entering commands.</li>
                <li>Mouse: Used to point, click, and drag objects on the screen.</li>
            </ul>
            There are many other input devices, such as scanners, webcams, microphones, joysticks, etc.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Explain the importance of using strong passwords.</strong><br>
            Strong passwords are important for computer security. They help prevent unauthorized access to your computer and data. A strong password should be:

            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Briefly explain what the term "cloud computing" refers to.</strong><br>
            Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services (like storage, servers, databases, software, etc.) over the internet. Users can access these services on-demand from anywhere with an internet connection. They don't need to manage the physical hardware or software themselves.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Bonus Question (3 points):</h3>
    <p><strong>List three basic computer maintenance tasks you can perform to keep your computer running smoothly.</strong></p>
